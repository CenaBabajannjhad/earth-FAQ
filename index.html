                            as astronauts have affectionately dubbed it. Appearances, however, can be deceiving. Planet
                            Earth is not, in fact, perfectly round.

                            This is not to say Earth is flat. Well before Columbus sailed the ocean blue, Aristotle and
                            other ancient Greek scholars proposed that Earth was round. This was based on a number of
                            observations, such as the fact that departing ships not only appeared smaller as they sailed
                            away but also seemed to sink into the horizon, as one might expect if sailing across a ball
                            says geographer Bill Carstensen of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>

                            of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Tidal forces between Earth
                            and the Moon have over time synchronized the Moon's orbital period (lunar month) with its
                            rotation period (lunar day) at 29.5 Earth days, causing the same side of the Moon to always
                            face Earth. The Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent, the Sun's are the main
                            drivers of Earth's tides.</p>
